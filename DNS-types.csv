KX;36;RFC 2230;Key Exchanger record;Used with some cryptographic systems (not including DNSSEC) to identify a key management agent for the associated domain-name. Note that this has nothing to do with DNS Security. It is Informational status, rather than being on the IETF standards-track. It has always had limited deployment, but is still in use.
LOC;29;RFC 1876;Location record;Specifies a geographical location associated with a domain name
MX;15;RFC 1035[1] and RFC 7505;Mail exchange record;List of mail exchange servers that accept email for a domain

PTR;12;RFC 1035[1];PTR Resource Record [de];Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups, but other uses include such things as DNS-SD.
RP;17;RFC 1183;Responsible Person;Information about the responsible person(s) for the domain. Usually an email address with the @ replaced by a .
RRSIG;46;RFC 4034;DNSSEC signature;Signature for a DNSSEC-secured record set. Uses the same format as the SIG record.
SIG;24;RFC 2535;Signature;Signature record used in SIG(0) (RFC 2931) and TKEY (RFC 2930).[7] RFC 3755 designated RRSIG as the replacement for SIG for use within DNSSEC.[7]

SSHFP;44;RFC 4255;SSH Public Key Fingerprint;Resource record for publishing SSH public host key fingerprints in the DNS, in order to aid in verifying the authenticity of the host. RFC 6594 defines ECC SSH keys and SHA-256 hashes. See the IANA SSHFP RR parameters registry for details.
SVCB;64;RFC 9460;Service Binding;RR that improves performance for clients that need to resolve many resources to access a domain.
TA;32768;—;DNSSEC Trust Authorities;Part of a deployment proposal for DNSSEC without a signed DNS root. See the IANA database and Weiler Spec for details. Uses the same format as the DS record.
TKEY;249;RFC 2930;Transaction Key record;A method of providing keying material to be used with TSIG that is encrypted under the public key in an accompanying KEY RR.[12]
TLSA;52;RFC 6698;TLSA certificate association;"A record for DANE. RFC 6698 defines ""The TLSA DNS resource record is used to associate a TLS server certificate or public key with the domain name where the record is found, thus forming a 'TLSA certificate association'""."
TSIG;250;RFC 2845;Transaction Signature;Can be used to authenticate dynamic updates as coming from an approved client, or to authenticate responses as coming from an approved recursive name server[13] similar to DNSSEC.
TXT;16;RFC 1035[1];Text record;Originally for arbitrary human-readable text in a DNS record. Since the early 1990s, however, this record more often carries machine-readable data, such as specified by RFC 1464, opportunistic encryption, Sender Policy Framework, DKIM, DMARC, DNS-SD, etc.
